# Good day/ night

I am Momchil Kalestrov. A student living in the hellscape named "The Balkans".
I'm currently studying programming. Is any of the code I write good? No, but
my teacher says it is and she's been doing this all her life so I'd assume
she knows better.

Multiple of my projects have been used in IT competitions and have won multiple awards. Here's a list:
- Venturo (can be accessed at traveler-game.vercel.app) has been awarded 2-nd place in the national forum "Science, technologies, innovations and business"
- BasicOS has been awarded in national competition "Young Inventors" and national conference "IT and Automation"
- Even though it isn't an award, BasicOS reached the national level of the national IT competition and got 6-th place in all Bulgaria
- MathTrix has been awarded 2-nd place in the national conference "Physics-engineering-technologies"
- PhysicsCalc 9G has been awarded 1-st place in the national conference "Physics-engineering-technologies"

But you may be asking: "What even are these projects?". Well, let me tell you about them:
- Venturo is a mobile game encouraging sightseeing in Bulgaria by earning badges and collecting XP
- BasicOS is an kernel I have been working on for the good part of 2 years now
- MathTrix is a PC board game aimed at young children where you have to get the highest score by using the mathematical operations on the board
- PhysicsCalc was a desktop program that visualized theories and automatically calculated formulas in the sphere of physics
