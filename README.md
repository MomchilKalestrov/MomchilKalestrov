# Good day/ night

I am Momchil Kalestrov. A student living in the hellscape named "The Balkans".
I'm currently studying programming. Is any of the code I write good? No, but
my teacher says it is and she's been doing this all her life so I'd assume
she knows better.

Multiple of my projects have been used in IT competitions and have won multiple awards. Here's a list:
- BasicOS has been awarded in national competition "Young Inventors" and national conference "IT and Automation"
- Even though it isn't an award, BasicOS reached the national level of the national IT competition and got 6-th place in all Bulgaria
- MathTrix has been awarded 2-nd place in the national conference "Physics-engineering-technologies"
- PhysicsCalc 9G has been awarded 1-st place in the national conference "Physics-engineering-technologies"
