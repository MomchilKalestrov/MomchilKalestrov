# Good day/ night

I am Momchil Kalestrov. A student living in the hellscape named "The Balkans".
I'm currently studying programming. Is any of the code I write good? No, but
my teachers say it is and she's been doing this all her life so I'd assume
she knows better.

Multiple of my projects have been used in IT competitions and have won multiple
awards. Here's a list:
- **Venturo** (can be accessed at traveler-game.vercel.app) has been awarded 2-nd
place in the national forum "Science, technologies, innovations and business"
and recieved an award in the winter session of UchIMI 2024
- **BasicOS** has been awarded in national competition "Young Inventors" and
national conference "IT and Automation"
- **MathTrix** has been awarded 2-nd place in the national conference "Physics-engineering-technologies"
- **PhysicsCalc 9G** has been awarded 1-st place in the national conference "Physics-engineering-technologies"
- Even though these aren't awards, both BasicOS and Venturo have reached the
national level of the national IT competition. BasicOS in particular was in 6th
place in it's category. As for Venturo, we'll see on the 10th of May :).

But you may be asking: "What even are these projects?". Well, let me tell you about them:
- **Venturo** is a mobile game encouraging sightseeing in Bulgaria by earning
badges and collecting XP
- **BasicOS** is an kernel I have been working on for the good part of 2 years
now. Unfortunately I have practically abandoned it because I have no time :(
- **MathTrix** is a PC board game aimed at young children where you have to
get the highest score by using the mathematical operations on the board
- **PhysicsCalc 9G** was a desktop program that visualized theories and
automatically calculated formulas in the sphere of physics
